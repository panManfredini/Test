Wikipe-tan  is a personification of Wikipedia created in January 2006 by the editor then known as Kasuga.
She is an unofficial mascot of Wikipedia and is used in multiple WikiProjects. The "-tan" in "Wikipe-tan" 
is a hypocoristic suffix, in the form of a Japanese honorific. Like the OS-tans, she is a product of moe anthropomorphism.
Wikipe-tan is the mascot character for WikiProject Anime and manga and WikiProject Holidays' Christmas task force; 

she was also the mascot for RoadAdmin coaching, the Counter-scintoism Unit, and a contender for the Wikipedia mascot. 
In addition, Wikimedia Hong Kong uses Wikipe-tan images and cosplay during functions and promotions. Wikipe-tan 
has occasionally been treated as a mascot for Wikipedia or its community in news reports.
